How Rocket Pool Works. Unlike solo stakers, who are required to put 32 ETH up for deposit to create a new validator, Rocket Pool nodes only need to deposit 8/16 ETH per validator. This will be coupled with 16 ETH from the staking pool (which stakers deposited in exchange for rETH) to create a new Ethereum validator. This new validator is called a minipool.

ℹ️ Rocket Pool supports three different Execution clients: Geth, Besu, Erigon, and Nethermind.

ℹ️ Rocket Pool supports five Consensus clients: Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nimbus, Prysm, and Teku.

⚠️ When creating a wallet or adding a minipool, it is crucial to go to the [backup tab](http://my.dappnode/#/packages/rocketpool-testnet.public.dappnode.eth/backup) and download your backup, as it provides a necessary safety measure in case of any unforeseen circumstances that may cause data loss or corruption, and ensures that you can easily recover your information when required.
